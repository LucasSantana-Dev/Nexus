# Lucky Command and Feature Roadmap (Benchmarked)

This roadmap maps Lucky's next bot-first command/features against mature patterns from
Dyno, Rythm, Loritta, MEE6, and Carl-bot. It is reliability-first and incremental.

## Benchmark Sources

- Dyno docs: https://docs.dyno.gg/en
- Dyno listing (module surface): https://top.gg/bot/155149108183695360
- Rythm commands: https://rythm.fm/docs/commands
- Loritta listing/features: https://top.gg/bot/297153970613387264
- MEE6 features: https://mee6.xyz/en/features
- Carl-bot docs: https://docs.carl.gg/

## Delivery Principles

- Bot-first: slash commands and bot-side behavior first, dashboard support only when required.
- Reliability-first: playback and moderation safety before growth features.
- One command per PR: isolate blast radius and make CI/review/rollback simple.
- No contract breaks: additive commands and metadata fields only.

## Rollout Guide (One Command per PR)

For each roadmap item:

1. Create one branch (`feature/<command-or-capability>` or `fix/<capability>`).
2. Implement only that command/feature plus required tests.
3. Update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` in the same PR.
4. Run package-targeted tests first, then monorepo lint/type-check/test gates.
5. Merge only after required checks are green and code review findings are resolved.

Recommended PR order follows the 6-week sequence above.
