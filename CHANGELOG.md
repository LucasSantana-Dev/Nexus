## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added centralized guild automation control plane for Criativaria with
  manifest persistence (`guild_automation_manifests`), run history
  (`guild_automation_runs`), and per-module drift snapshots
  (`guild_automation_drifts`)
- Added `/guildconfig` management command with `capture`, `plan`, `apply`,
  `reconcile`, `status`, and `cutover` subcommands for native-first server
  orchestration
- Added backend automation API routes under
  `/api/guilds/:guildId/automation/*` for manifest CRUD, run execution, status,
  and cutover operations

- Added `docs/BOT_COMMAND_ROADMAP_BENCHMARKS.md` with a benchmark-driven Lucky
  command roadmap (Dyno, Rythm, Loritta, MEE6, Carl-bot references), prioritized
  matrix, and a one-command-per-PR rollout plan for the next 6 weeks
- Frontend neo-editorial design foundation: semantic UI tokens in
  `packages/frontend/src/index.css` plus reusable primitives (`Shell`,
  `SectionHeader`, `EmptyState`, `StatTile`, `ActionPanel`) for consistent
  dashboard composition
- Added guild RBAC persistence model (`guild_role_grants`) and shared evaluator
  service with module keys (`overview`, `settings`, `moderation`, `automation`,
  `music`, `integrations`) plus `view`/`manage` modes
- Added backend RBAC and member-context endpoints:
  `GET/PUT /api/guilds/:guildId/rbac` and `GET /api/guilds/:id/me`
- Added frontend Access Control section in Server Settings to manage module
  grants by Discord role as full-policy replacement
- Added public legal routes for Discord app metadata:
  `/terms-of-service`, `/privacy-policy` with aliases `/terms`, `/privacy`
- Added public install redirect endpoint (`/api/install`) and canonical install
  link (`https://lucky.lucassantana.tech/install`) for Discord app installation
- Added Discord Activities URL mapping policy for embedded app setup:
  root prefix `/` targets `lucky.lucassantana.tech` with no proxy path mappings
- `/serversetup` now supports `template:criativaria` with optional
  `mode:apply|dry-run`, including idempotent setup orchestration and dry-run
  summaries (PR #164)
- Added bot tests for command registration coverage, command-file filtering, and
  `/serversetup` template/mode behavior (`register.spec`,
  `getCommandsFromDirectory.spec`, `serversetup.spec`, `serversetupCriativaria.spec`) (PR #164)

### Fixed

- Bot `/autoplay` command now resolves guild queue from player node cache when
  direct node lookup misses, preventing false `No music queue found` errors
  while a track is actively playing
- Dashboard guild listing now resolves bot membership through a backend Discord
  API fallback when the bot client cache is unavailable, restoring server
  visibility for split-process deployments
- Last.fm dashboard connect flow now respects configured API base/origin and
  callback state can be validated from cookie or query for split-origin setups
- Autoplay Last.fm scrobbling now falls back to stored requester metadata so
  recommended tracks keep the original requester attribution
- Last.fm connect callback URL generation now ignores invalid relative
  `WEBAPP_BACKEND_URL` values and falls back to the OAuth-derived absolute
  origin so production links always include an absolute callback URL
- Bot `/lastfm link` now prioritizes absolute `WEBAPP_BACKEND_URL` for connect
  URL host generation (fallback: `WEBAPP_REDIRECT_URI` origin), preventing
  stale legacy domains from appearing in user-facing link embeds (PR #163)
- `/api/health/auth-config` now accepts forwarded request-origin fallback when
  `WEBAPP_BACKEND_URL` is unset, preventing false degraded deploy-gate failures
  while keeping OAuth callback path and origin validation active
- Guild list/dashboard metrics now return nullable live values from bot/API
  enrichment (no forced `0` fallback when metrics are unavailable)
- Sidebar profile identity now resolves as `nick > global_name > username`
  with secondary label `@username` (removed legacy `#0` discriminator behavior)
- Frontend shell now initializes guild selection on all authenticated routes,
  so the server selector is populated right after login instead of only after
  visiting pages that manually triggered guild loading (PR #162)
- Vercel deep links now use a final SPA fallback rewrite after `/api` and
  `/install`, and README now documents the complete Discord portal URL mapping
  (General Information, Installation, and Activities URL Mappings)
- `/install` now proxies to `/api/auth/discord` so the public install URL
  reliably returns Discord OAuth redirect (`302`) on production
- `/serversetup` now explicitly preserves managed server visual identity and
  does not modify guild icon/splash/banner (PR #164)
- Bot runtime command loading now includes `management`, `moderation`, and
  `automod` categories
- Command directory loading now ignores `*.spec.*` and `*.test.*` modules so
  test files are never registered as slash commands
- Dashboard guild authorization now tolerates per-guild context failures
  instead of dropping the full `/api/guilds` response when one guild fails
- Discord guild permission parsing now supports payload drift
  (`permissions`/`permissions_new`) and safely handles invalid permission values
- `/api/guilds` now maps recoverable Discord OAuth/scope/session failures to
  actionable auth responses (401/403) and maps upstream Discord outages to 502
- `GET /api/guilds/:id/me` no longer requires `overview` module access so the
  dashboard can always bootstrap member context for authorized users
- Server selector now distinguishes true empty authorization from
  fetch/auth/session failures, showing retry and re-auth actions for failure
  states instead of a misleading empty result
- Features route guard mapping is now consistent under the `automation` module
  across frontend route guards, sidebar module checks, and backend route guards
- `/servers` is now always accessible for authenticated users (not blocked by
  module RBAC guards), while server/module pages remain module-gated
- Guild auto-selection now picks the first server where Lucky is already added;
  when no server has Lucky installed, dashboard keeps no selected server and
  shows explicit selection guidance
- Refs: PR `#169`
- Guild automation API routes now map known precondition failures to actionable
  4xx responses instead of opaque 500s (`manifest missing`, `capture required`,
  `apply lock active`) (PR #171)
- Guild automation backend apply/reconcile endpoints now execute real Discord
  and DB mutations through a shared execution pipeline (capture -> plan ->
  protected-op gate -> execute -> persisted final status)
- `/api/guilds/:guildId/automation/apply` and `/reconcile` now return explicit
  infrastructure failures when the distributed lock backend is unavailable
  (fail-closed contract)
- Guild automation diff now marks permission-tightening updates as protected
  operations so `allowProtected` gating applies to destructive updates (PR #171)
- Guild cutover role cleanup now only mutates bots explicitly flagged
  `retireOnCutover: true`, preventing role removal from unrelated integrations
  (PR #171)
- Criativaria `/serversetup` now uses explicit upsert client typings for
  auto-message, embed template, and custom command operations, preventing
  stale shared declaration drift from breaking bot typecheck resolution.

### Changed

- Bot command registration now loads moderation/automod/management command
  groups through the active register pipeline, so centralized management
  commands are consistently available after startup
- Removed unused legacy layout components (`DashboardLayout`, `Header`,
  `Navbar`) from frontend layout module to reduce duplicate shell patterns
- Frontend app shell (`Layout` + `Sidebar`) and login page now use the
  neo-editorial dark framing with improved active navigation states, clearer
  server selector affordances, stronger empty-state guidance, and mobile drawer
  parity
- Dashboard overview, servers page, and Last.fm page now use the shared
  neo-editorial primitives for denser status cards, clearer loading/empty/error
  states, and more consistent scan hierarchy
- Guild selector now shows authorized guilds directly (including admin-visible
  guilds without bot presence) and labels missing-bot guilds with an invite
  indicator
- Guild/module routes now use module-aware access middleware so read requests
  require `view` and mutating requests require `manage`
- Bot Jest config now maps relative `.js` imports to source modules during test
  execution, matching the ESM build import style
- Guild automation reconcile now uses ID-first matching with deterministic
  fallback for roles/channels and persists remapped manifest IDs for future
  convergent plans
- Shared guild automation lock flow now uses Redis token-based distributed locks
  (`SET NX PX` + safe token release) instead of in-memory instance-local locks

## [2.6.12] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- Guild automation apply/reconcile APIs now execute real Discord + DB mutations
  through the backend execution pipeline instead of record-only runs.
- Guild automation route error mapping now returns explicit responses for lock
  backend outages (503 fail-closed) and shared preconditions.
- Shared automation flow now uses typed guild-automation domain errors to keep
  route/service failure contracts deterministic.

### Changed

- Distributed execution lock is now Redis-backed with tokenized acquire/release
  semantics and safe-release verification.
- Reconcile convergence keeps ID-first matching with deterministic fallback and
  persists remapped manifest IDs for future convergent runs.
- Bot automation apply helpers were refactored to reduce complexity while
  preserving module behavior.

### Verification

- `npm run test --workspace=packages/bot -- src/functions/management/commands/guildconfig.spec.ts src/utils/guildAutomation/applyPlan.spec.ts src/utils/guildAutomation/captureGuildState.spec.ts`
- `CI/CD Pipeline` and `SonarCloud Scan` checks passed on PR #179.

## [2.6.11] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- Docker publish reliability in CI images: npm cache mounts are now isolated per
  stage with locked sharing, and `npm ci` failures are no longer masked by
  cache-verify fallback logic.
- Dashboard/server visibility stabilization from PR #169 is now on `main`,
  including resilient guild authorization handling, safer Discord permissions
  parsing, server selector error-state clarity, and authenticated `/servers`
  access.
- Backlog merge completion for PRs #163, #168, #164, and #169 in the same
  cycle.

### Changed

- OAuth callback policy for production docs is now explicitly frontend-host
  canonical (`https://lucky.lucassantana.tech/api/auth/callback`) for Discord
  portal alignment in this release cycle.

## [2.6.10] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- OAuth/dashboard stabilization for split frontend/API origins with canonical
  callback handling and stronger auth config health diagnostics.
- Dashboard and shell data reliability across routes: selected guild re-sync,
  RBAC-aware quick actions/nav behavior, and member context availability for
  authorized module users.
- Sidebar identity rendering now consistently resolves as
  `nick > globalName > username` with `@username` secondary label.
- Cross-page E2E contract mismatches in redesigned shell pages
  (automod, features, servers, music, twitch, track-history, visual baselines).

### Changed

- Route/module policy alignment keeps `/features` under the `automation` access
  module and preserves deny-by-default RBAC behavior.
- Updated Playwright visual baselines for servers, dashboard, features, sidebar,
  loading, and error states.

### Security

- Removed Deezer support from music source unions and web import surfaces
  (`discord-player-deezer` removed).

## [2.6.9] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- Deploy workflow OAuth smoke gates now retry contract validation during rollout
  (auth-config and `/api/auth/discord`) instead of failing immediately when
  checking a still-updating backend
- Auth config health now marks `degraded` when `CLIENT_ID` differs from the
  expected production app id (`WEBAPP_EXPECTED_CLIENT_ID`, with production
  fallback) to detect Discord OAuth credential drift

## [2.6.8] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- Auth config health response now includes non-secret OAuth diagnostics
  (`auth.clientId`, `auth.authorizeUrlPreview`) and marks `degraded` when the
  OAuth redirect origin does not match configured frontend origins
- Deploy workflow now enforces OAuth redirect contract validation on
  `/api/auth/discord` (HTTP 302, expected Discord `client_id`, expected
  `redirect_uri`) before treating deploy as successful

## [2.6.7] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- Deploy webhook script now pins `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=lucky` and auto-resolves
  the live compose working directory so webhook rollouts executed from `/repo`
  target the existing stack instead of failing on container-name conflicts
- Webhook service now runs deploy commands from `/home/luk-server/Lucky` so
  compose metadata matches the homelab stack and avoids container recreation
  conflicts during webhook-driven deploys
- Deploy lock handling now recovers stale `/tmp/lucky-deploy.lock` directories
  (PID-aware) after interrupted deploys instead of blocking all future runs
- Backend startup now attempts to connect the shared Redis client before serving
  requests, while continuing with fallback behavior if Redis is unavailable
- Deploy workflow auth smoke gate now strictly requires
  `/api/health/auth-config` with `status=ok`, no warnings, and healthy
  auth-session/Redis flags (no fallback to generic health endpoint)
- Backend route handlers now use schema-typed request parsing and explicit auth
  user-id guards (removed unsafe `any` request/body/query reads and non-null
  assertions across management, moderation, music, toggles, and twitch routes)
- Session middleware now uses typed `session-file-store` import wiring and
  strict `connect-redis` adapter wiring without unsafe casts

### Added

- New auth readiness endpoint: `GET /api/health/auth-config` returning
  `status`, auth/runtime flags, and deploy-safe warnings for OAuth/session
  validation

### Changed

- Backend lint no longer uses scoped ignore guardrails; strict lint now runs
  across the full backend package by default (issue #136 closure)
- Repository hygiene now ignores local Vercel environment artifacts
  (`.env.vercel.*`) and removes merged stale branches conservatively (merged
  local + merged remote only)

## [2.6.6] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- Lucky branding artifacts in `packages/frontend/branding`:
  `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and `BRANDING_GUIDE.md`
- Lucky logo and favicon runtime assets in `packages/frontend/public`
- Bot presence rotation module with richer profile-facing activities and live runtime stats

### Fixed

- Frontend lint now uses ESLint flat config (`packages/frontend/eslint.config.js`) so TypeScript/TSX parsing works correctly with ESLint 10
- CI quality gates now run package-level lint commands for frontend and backend, matching local verification workflow
- OAuth authorize/callback now resolves callback URI with same-origin precedence (`session` -> `WEBAPP_REDIRECT_URI` -> forwarded host), preventing split-session landing loops
- Added `/auth/callback` compatibility alias and callback-path normalization so legacy `/auth/callback` values still resolve to `/api/auth/callback`
- Backend server now enables `trust proxy` in production so secure session cookies are correctly issued behind nginx/Cloudflare
- Backend CORS now accepts configured origins plus `*.lucassantana.tech` and `*.luk-homeserver.com.br` hosts for dashboard/API split-domain setups
- Backend auth/Last.fm redirect targets now use the primary frontend origin when `WEBAPP_FRONTEND_URL` contains multiple comma-separated domains
- Backend OAuth session persistence now uses a connect-redis v9 compatibility adapter for ioredis clients, preventing callback save failures
- Frontend API inference now uses same-origin `/api` for `*.lucassantana.tech` to keep OAuth/session requests on one browser origin
- Nginx now normalizes `X-Forwarded-Proto` from edge headers (defaulting to `https`) so secure dashboard session cookies are emitted behind Cloudflare Tunnel
- Deploy smoke check now falls back to `/api/health` when `/api/health/auth-config` is unavailable
- Vercel routing no longer rewrites `/api/*` back to the same Lucky host, preventing `508 INFINITE_LOOP` on OAuth login
- Frontend API base URL now supports `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for hosted deployments that use a separate backend origin
- Vercel now forwards `/api/*` directly to `https://lucky-api.lucassantana.tech/api/*` to prevent frontend-host `404 NOT_FOUND` on OAuth/API routes
- Deploy webhook trigger now uses strict curl connect/request timeouts to avoid long hangs in CI deploy jobs
- Deploy webhook trigger now retries longer on 5xx/network failures, logs every attempt, and falls back to canonical `/webhook/deploy` path for all non-2xx responses
- Music now-playing updates no longer send extra plain-text messages on every track change
- Music now-playing embeds now reuse one message per guild channel to reduce chat spam
- Music now-playing footer/requested fields now use plain text formatting in Discord footers
- Last.fm scrobbling now records the finished/skipped track explicitly from player events
- Last.fm connect route now supports authenticated dashboard flow without requiring query `state`
- Autoplay queue replenishment now searches and enqueues a related track when queue is empty
- Deploy workflow now retries webhook calls with `/webhook/deploy` after HTTP 405
- Deploy script now restarts Cloudflare tunnel (`cloudflared`) during rollout
- Deploy script now prevents concurrent runs with a lock to avoid overlapping container rollouts
- Deploy script now falls back to restarting `lucky-tunnel` directly when compose profile restart is unavailable
- Frontend theming now maps legacy `lucky-*` classes to the Lucky purple/gold palette
- Frontend typography now uses Lucky type tokens (`Sora`, `Manrope`, `JetBrains Mono`) instead of the old default stack
- Vercel build now generates Prisma client before shared/frontend builds to prevent missing generated client errors
- OAuth callback now reuses the same redirect URI across auth start/callback token exchange, with forwarded-host fallback for proxied HTTPS deployments
- E2E stability improvements: dashboard/servers/track-history tests now use deterministic locators and route-delay handling
- Autoplay no longer keeps cycling the same recommendations; queue top-up now uses anti-repeat filtering and keeps a 4-track buffer
- Shuffle now works reliably while autoplay is enabled because autoplay maintains enough upcoming tracks
- Web music repeat mode now supports `autoplay` end-to-end (bot mapper, backend validation, shared/frontend types)

### Changed

- Backend lint scripts now include scoped guardrails for legacy strict-rule debt files and expose `npm run lint:full --workspace=packages/backend` for full debt tracking (follow-up: #136)
- Added `WEBAPP_BACKEND_URL` env propagation in Docker compose stacks and updated OAuth setup docs/examples to use same-origin callback URLs in production
- Added root npm deploy shortcuts: `npm run deploy:remote` and `npm run deploy:homelab`
- `scripts/deploy-remote.sh` now targets workflow file `deploy.yml` and waits for the dispatch run more reliably
- `scripts/deploy-remote.sh` now always prints failed GitHub Actions logs before exiting
- Added typography specification to Lucky brand docs (`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and `BRANDING_GUIDE.md`)
- Updated Lucky design/branding docs to define purple (`#8b5cf6`) and gold (`#d4a017`) as main brand colors with usage roles
- Added Lucky production tunnel snippet and `nexus` -> `lucky` zero-downtime migration checklist to Cloudflare/deploy docs
- Pinned Node engine to `22.x` to avoid unexpected major-version upgrades in CI/Vercel builds

  - `border-bg-border` → `border-lucky-border`
- All pages and components now use consistent `lucky-*` design tokens

### Fixed - Auth redirect loop

- Added in-memory session fallback when Redis is unavailable in `SessionService`
- Sessions now use `Map<string, string>` when `redisClient.isHealthy()` returns false
- Fixed `.env` `REDIS_HOST=redis` (Docker service name) → `localhost` for local dev
- Auth flow no longer silently drops session data without Redis

### Added - AutoMod mute action and case tracking

- Implemented `mute` action in automod violation handler using Discord native timeout API
- Default automod mute duration: 5 minutes (300s)
- All automod violations now delete the offending message first
- `warn` action creates moderation case via ModerationService
- `kick` and `ban` actions now also create moderation cases (previously fire-and-forget)
- Bot user recorded as moderator with `[AutoMod]` reason prefix for audit trail

### Fixed - Express 5 type safety

- Added `p()` helper for `string | string[]` param extraction (Express 5 breaking change)
- Fixed `req.params` destructuring in management, moderation, embeds, auto-messages routes
- Fixed `return res.json()` → `res.json(); return` for asyncHandler void compatibility
- Fixed `p()` not applied to Zod-coerced number params (caseNumber) or optional query params
- Replaced `type as any` with `type as 'welcome' | 'leave'` in auto-messages

### Added - Test coverage improvements

- `LastFmAuthService` unit tests (11 tests, 0% -> 100% coverage)
- `AppError.forbidden()` default message branch test
- Coverage: statements 96%, branches 84%, functions 100%, lines 96%
  (362 tests across 24 suites)

- `guildStore` Zustand tests (9 tests — fetch, select, update, error handling)
- `featuresStore` Zustand tests (9 tests — global/server toggles, defaults)
- `useServerFilter` hook tests (5 tests — filter all/with-bot/without-bot)
- 30 frontend tests across 4 suites, all passing

### Removed

- Unused `featuresApi.ts` (duplicated inline in `api.ts`)
- Phantom API endpoints with no backend routes (logs export, single log, clear)

### Added - Skills.sh ecosystem skills and Serena project memory

- **`.agent-skills/`**: 10 skills installed from skills.sh ecosystem — `systematic-debugging`, `test-driven-development`, `brainstorming`, `verification-before-completion`, `requesting-code-review` (obra/superpowers); `vercel-react-best-practices`, `web-design-guidelines` (vercel-labs/agent-skills); `nodejs-backend-patterns`, `typescript-advanced-types`, `database-migration` (wshobson/agents)
- **`.serena/memories/`**: 6 Serena project memory files — `project-overview.md`, `current-state.md`, `known-gotchas.md`, `next-priorities.md`, `db-and-services.md`, `agent-workflow.md`
- **`.cursor/hooks/session-context.sh`**: Updated to instruct agents to load Serena memories at session start
- **`AGENTS.md`**: Added "Session Start" protocol and "Ecosystem skills" table for `.agent-skills/` skills

### Fixed - EmbedBuilderService implementation (Phase 7 unblocked)

- Created `packages/shared/src/services/EmbedBuilderService.ts` with full CRUD for embed templates

**Command Categories Added**
- Updated `packages/bot/src/config/constants.ts` with new categories:
  - `moderation` - 🛡️ Moderation commands
  - `automod` - 🤖 Auto-Moderation commands
  - `management` - 📋 Management commands

**Total Commands Implemented: 15**
- 9 moderation commands
- 1 auto-moderation command (with 7 subcommands)
- 3 management commands (with multiple subcommands each)

**Next Steps** (requires database migration first):
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_moderation_and_management_systems
npm run db:generate
```

After migration:
- Test all commands in Discord server
- Fix remaining type errors in service method signatures
- Implement event handlers for auto-moderation (messageCreate, guildMemberAdd, guildMemberRemove)
- Implement modal handlers for embed creation
- Add button interaction handlers for case pagination

### Added - Comprehensive Moderation and Management System (Phases 1-3)

npm run db:generate
```

### Changed - docs: remove MCP references

- **Removed**: `docs/MCP_SETUP.md` (Cursor tool/server setup no longer in docs).
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: New “Cursor” subsection: hooks in `.cursor/hooks.json` and `.cursor/hooks/`; agent behavior and tool usage in AGENTS.md.
- **README.md**: AI development section no longer links to MCP_SETUP; AGENTS.md bullet no longer mentions “MCP tools”.
- **docs/INFISICAL.md**: All “MCP” wording replaced with “Cursor” / “Infisical in Cursor” / “Settings → Tools”.
- **AGENTS.md**: Docs list and Context Forge line no longer reference MCP_SETUP; gateway connection described as “Cursor config / gateway project”.

### Changed - docs cleanup

- **Removed**: UI_PROMPT.md (one-off design spec), youtube-error-handling.md (implementation detail), PORTAINER-SETUP.md (optional path; Portainer note moved to DOCKER.md), REDIS-INTEGRATION.md (content merged into ARCHITECTURE Data layer).
- **Trimmed**: sentry-monitoring.md (env vars and link only), MUSIC_RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM.md (overview, features, commands, related).
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Added Data layer (Prisma, Redis), Monitoring (Sentry), Troubleshooting (YouTube parser errors). Quick reference updated.
- **DOCKER.md**: Optional Portainer section (scripts/portainer-*). **FRONTEND.md**: Removed UI_PROMPT reference.

### Changed - Context Forge gateway: Docker only

- **docs/MCP_SETUP.md**: MCP Gateway (Context Forge) section now describes running the gateway with Docker only (no uvx/Python). Cursor connects via the Docker-based stdio wrapper; virtual server URL uses `host.docker.internal` so the wrapper container can reach the host gateway. Linux note: add `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` to the wrapper `docker run` args.
- **docs/mcp.json.example**: Context Forge entry uses `docker` as command with `run --rm -i -e MCP_SERVER_URL=... -e MCP_AUTH=... ghcr.io/ibm/mcp-context-forge:latest python3 -m mcpgateway.wrapper` so no local Python is required. Gateway project (separate repo) README and start.sh are Docker-only.

### Added - Cursor subagents, skills, commands, and MCP guidance

- **Subagents**: Four specialist rules in `.cursor/rules/` — `subagent-frontend.mdc`, `subagent-backend.mdc`, `subagent-discord.mdc`, `subagent-data.mdc`. Apply when acting as that specialist or when the task is primarily that area; each references the matching area rule and skills.
- **Skills**: New project skills in `.cursor/skills/` — `frontend-react-vite` (React, Vite, Tailwind in packages/frontend), `backend-express` (Express API in packages/backend), `e2e-playwright` (E2E tests and browser MCP usage), `mcp-docs-search` (when to use Context7, Tavily, sequential-thinking, etc.).
- **Commands**: `.cursor/COMMANDS.md` documents standard workflows — verify (lint, typecheck, build, test), test E2E, DB operations, deploy checklist, and when to use which subagent/skill.
- **Session hook**: `session-context.sh` now injects subagents, COMMANDS.md, and MCP usage in addition to AGENTS.md and skills.
- **AGENTS.md**: Cursor rules section lists subagents; skills table extended with the four new skills; new “Commands (workflows)” section pointing to `.cursor/COMMANDS.md`; MCP table updated (browser-tools, apify-dribbble, cloudflare naming; note on radar_search, mcp-gateway, desktop-commander, MCP_DOCKER, curl). Hooks section updated to mention subagents and COMMANDS.md.

### Added - Superpowers (Codex) in chat and prompts

- **AGENTS.md**: New “Superpowers (Codex)” section: how to load a skill in Cursor chat or prompts (run `~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex use-skill <skill-name>` with a real skill name), table of available skill names, and agent behavior (run the command when the user asks for a superpowers skill; use MCP tools as needed).
- **docs/MCP_SETUP.md**: Short note on Superpowers and link to AGENTS.md for the skill list.

### Added - Pre-commit secret analyzer

- **Secretlint**: Pre-commit runs Secretlint on staged files (via lint-staged) to block commits that contain credentials. CI runs `npm run lint:secrets` (Secretlint on full codebase) in Quality Gates to block PRs that introduce secrets. Uses `@secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend` (AWS/GCP/GitHub tokens, private keys, basic auth, etc.). Config: `.secretlintrc.json`; ignore list: `.secretlintignore`. Documented in docs/CI_CD.md and README.

### Added - Cursor Hooks

- **Cursor Hooks**: Project-level hooks in `.cursor/hooks.json` and `.cursor/hooks/*.sh` for session context injection, format-after-edit (Prettier + ESLint on edited file), shell guard (block dangerous commands), and optional stop logging to `.cursor/hooks.log`. Documented in AGENTS.md and docs/MCP_SETUP.md. `.gitignore` updated so only `.cursor/hooks.json` and `.cursor/hooks/*.sh` are tracked; `.cursor/hooks.log` remains ignored.

### Changed - Docker optimization

- **Frontend**: Added `nginx/frontend.conf` for static-only serving (SPA fallback); frontend container no longer uses reverse-proxy config.
- **Dockerfile**: Split production into `production-bot` (full runtime with ffmpeg/opus/yt-dlp) and `production-backend` (slim node:alpine). Backend healthcheck uses HTTP check on root.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Expose only nginx (port 8080); removed frontend and backend host ports. Added json-file logging (max-size 10m, max-file 3) for all services. Build targets updated to `production-bot` and `production-backend`.
- **docker-compose.dev.yml**: Renamed network and containers to `lucky-*`. Added postgres service for full-stack dev. Same logging limits.
- **scripts/discord-bot.sh**: Dev build uses main Dockerfile with `--target development --build-arg SERVICE=bot` (no root Dockerfile.dev). Production build uses `--target production-bot`. Image tags: `lucky-bot:dev`, `lucky-bot:latest`.
- **Deploy workflow**: Build step uses `--target production-bot` for server image.
- **.dockerignore**: Added `**/dist/` for package build outputs.
- **docs**: Added [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md); updated [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) Docker section.

### Fixed - Setup and docs consistency

- **Commitlint**: Added `@commitlint/cli` and `@commitlint/config-conventional` to root devDependencies so the commit-msg hook works on fresh install.
- **Env example**: Standardized on `.env.example`; updated README, scripts/discord-bot.sh, and CHANGELOG references from `env.example` to `.env.example`.
- **docs/DEPENDENCIES.md**: Updated stack overview and packages/frontend section to Vite 7, React 19, Tailwind 4; noted Zod 4 deferred; adjusted upgrade order.
- **README**: Aligned CI/Deploy badges, clone URL, and support links with canonical repo LucasSantana-Dev/Lucky.

### Changed - Ignore Playwright report and test-results

- **.gitignore**
  - Added `packages/frontend/playwright-report/` and `packages/frontend/test-results/` so E2E output does not show as modified.

### Changed - Phase 3: @smithy override attempt (incompatible)

- Tried root `overrides` for `@smithy/config-resolver@>=4.4.0` to address critical advisory; incompatible with AWS SDK v3 chain used by @infisical/sdk (SDK v3 depends on @smithy v3). Override reverted. Documented in `docs/DEPENDENCY_UPDATES.md`; wait for @infisical/sdk to upgrade to an AWS SDK that pulls @smithy v4+.

### Changed - Phase 2d (continued): Other frontend majors

- **packages/frontend**
  - Bumped `tailwind-merge` ^2.6 → ^3.0 (Tailwind v4–aligned), `date-fns` ^3.6 → ^4.1, `framer-motion` ^11.18 → ^12.0, `recharts` ^2.15 → ^3.0. Typecheck, build, and backend tests pass.

### Changed - Phase 3: Audit and known vulnerabilities (tracking)

- Re-ran `npm audit` and `npm run audit:critical` after Phase 2d. Known issues remain as documented in `docs/DEPENDENCY_UPDATES.md`: @smithy/config-resolver (via @infisical/sdk), hono/lodash (via prisma), tar (via @discordjs/opus, unleash-client), undici (via discord.js, youtubei.js). No `audit fix --force` or overrides applied; track upstream fixes.

### Changed - Phase 2d: Vite 6 → 7 (frontend)

- **packages/frontend**
  - Upgraded `vite` from ^6.0.7 to ^7.0.0 and `@vitejs/plugin-react` from ^4.3.4 to ^5.0.0. Vite 7 requires Node 20.19+ or 22.12+; CI uses Node 22. No config changes required (no Sass legacy API, deprecated plugins, or advanced options in use).

### Changed - Phase 2c: Zod v3 → v4 (deferred)

- **Zod 4 upgrade deferred:** `@hookform/resolvers` (v3) is not yet compatible with Zod 4.3.x types (`ZodObject` not assignable to `Zod3Type`). Frontend and shared keep `zod@^3.25.x` and `@hookform/resolvers@^3.10.x` until the resolver supports Zod 4. See `docs/DEPENDENCY_UPDATES.md` (Phase 2c).

### Changed - Phase 2b: React 18 → 19 (frontend)

- **packages/frontend**
  - Bumped `react` and `react-dom` to `^19.0.0`, `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to `^19.0.0`. Radix UI and other UI libs work with React 19; typecheck and build pass.

### Changed - Phase 2a: Tailwind CSS v4 (frontend)

- **packages/frontend**
  - Upgraded Tailwind CSS from v3.4 to v4.1 via `npx @tailwindcss/upgrade`. Replaced `@tailwind base/components/utilities` with `@import 'tailwindcss'`; migrated theme (colors, radius, keyframes, animations) to `@theme` and `@utility` in `src/index.css`. Removed `tailwind.config.js` (v4 CSS-first config). Replaced `autoprefixer` with `@tailwindcss/postcss`. Updated `components.json` to reference `src/index.css` as Tailwind config source.

### Changed - Phase 1 dependency updates

- **Root package.json**
  - Added `prisma@^7.3.0` (devDependencies). Bumped `@prisma/client` to `^7.3.0`, `prettier` to `^3.8.1`, `globals` to `^17.2.0`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` to `^8.54.0`.
- **Workspaces**
  - **shared**: `@prisma/client@^7.3.0`, `@sentry/node@^10.37.0`, `ioredis@^5.9.2`, `@types/node@^25.1.0`.
  - **backend**: `express-session@^1.19.0`, `@types/node@^25.1.0`.
  - **bot**: `ws@^8.19.0`, `@sentry/node@^10.37.0`, `@types/node@^25.1.0`.
  - **frontend**: patch/minor bumps for `axios`, `react-router-dom`, `lucide-react`, `@typescript-eslint/*`, `postcss` (no major upgrades in this phase).
- **Backend tests**
  - Updated `express-session` mock in `tests/setup.ts` so it returns a stable middleware (no `jest.fn()` cleared by `resetMocks`), parses session cookie into `req.sessionID`, and provides `req.session.save` / `req.session.destroy` for auth routes.
  - Adjusted 401 expectations: unauthenticated requests (no cookie) now expect `error: 'Not authenticated'`; auth error tests updated to expect 302 redirects with query params where the app redirects on error.
  - Toggles integration: added `express.json()` and re-applied `getFeatureToggleConfig` mock after `clearAllMocks`; OAuth callback tests set session cookie so `req.sessionID` is present.
- **Verification**
  - Ran `npm install`, `npm update`, `npm audit fix` (no `--force`). `type:check`, `build`, `test:ci`, and `audit:critical` pass.

### Added - Dependency update plan

- **docs/DEPENDENCY_UPDATES.md**
  - Phased plan: Phase 1 (safe patch/minor + audit fix, add Prisma CLI), Phase 2 (optional majors: Tailwind v4, React 19, Zod 4, Vite 7), Phase 3 (transitive/security tracking, no force-downgrade). References Tailwind v4 upgrade guide and Prisma 7; rollback and verification steps included.

### Fixed - Pre-commit hook (audit blocking commits)

- **.husky/pre-commit**
  - Removed `audit:high` from the hook; only `audit:critical` runs before each commit so commits are not blocked by high-severity transitive vulnerabilities (e.g. hono, tar, undici).
- **docs/CI_CD.md**
  - Pre-commit section updated: only critical vulnerabilities block commits; high-severity issues remain visible in CI (Quality Gates).

### Fixed - Deploy pipeline (missing SSH secrets)

- **.github/workflows/deploy.yml**
  - Added "Check deploy secrets" step: fails with a clear list of missing secrets and a pointer to docs when `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SSH_USER`, or `SSH_HOST` are not set in GitHub Actions secrets.
- **docs/CI_CD.md**
  - Added "Deploy secrets (how to add)" with a table and instructions for getting user/host from a local SSH host alias (e.g. `server-do-luk`) and adding the three repository secrets.

### Fixed - CI pipeline (missing lock file)

- **Root**
  - Removed `package-lock.json` from `.gitignore` so the root lock file is committed. CI uses `actions/setup-node@v4` with `cache: 'npm'` and `npm ci`, which require a lock file at the repo root.
- **docs/CI_CD.md**
  - Added "Lock file" section: root `package-lock.json` must be committed for CI.

### Changed - Monorepo cleanup (remove legacy root src/tests)

- **Root**
  - Removed legacy `src/` (config, events, functions, handlers, services, types, utils, webapp) and `tests/` (e2e, integration, load, performance, services, utils, setup); removed `tsup.config.ts`. All code and tests now live in packages.
- **packages**
  - Backend: middleware, routes (including Last.fm), package.json.
  - Bot: config, music commands (including queue re-export), handlers, player trackHandlers, utils (autoplay, duplicateDetection, titleComparison, trackManagement), Last.fm and Twitch modules, package.json.
  - Frontend: removed featureStore.
  - Shared: services index, types (music, optional-infisical), LastFmLinkService, GuildSettingsService, TrackHistoryService, TwitchNotificationService; removed module-alias.d.ts.
- **prisma**
  - Schema updates.
- **docs**
  - .env.example, docs/INFISICAL.md, docs/MUSIC_RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM.md, docs/WEBAPP_SETUP.md updated.
- **config**
  - .gitignore, ecosystem.config.cjs, jest.config.cjs aligned with monorepo.

### Changed - ARCHITECTURE.md implementation

- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**
  - Quick reference line at top with links to Package structure, Package layouts, Command loading, Building, Dependencies.
  - New "Entry points" section: bot (`src/index.ts` → `initializeBot()`), backend (`src/index.ts` → `startWebApp()`), frontend (`main.tsx`), shared (consumed by bot/backend).
  - Nginx: clarified that nginx listens on 80 and is exposed as 8080 on host; `location /api` and `/api/*` → backend:3000, `/` → frontend:80; config path `nginx/nginx.conf`.
  - Docker: table format for postgres, redis, bot, backend, frontend, nginx with roles.
  - New "Repo checklist (matches this doc)": no root src/, Prisma at root, command loading pattern, backend routes/services, nginx routing.
- **README.md**
  - Architecture section updated to describe ARCHITECTURE.md as the single source of truth (entry points, where to add code, command loading, Nginx/Docker, principles).

### Added - CI/CD and testing improvements

- **CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)**
  - Quality Gates: lint, type-check (shared, bot, backend, frontend), build (all packages), backend `test:ci`, backend `test:coverage`, npm audit (high), check:outdated. Coverage uploaded to Codecov from `packages/backend/coverage/lcov.info`.
  - E2E job: runs after Quality Gates; installs Playwright Chromium in frontend, runs `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright tests for the web app).
- **Root package.json**
  - `type:check` and `build` now include `packages/frontend`.
  - New scripts: `test:e2e` (runs frontend Playwright), `audit:critical`, `audit:high` for pre-commit and CI.
- **Pre-commit (Husky)**
  - Pre-commit runs lint-staged (ESLint + Prettier), then `npm run audit:critical` and `npm run audit:high` (block commit on critical/high vulnerabilities). Commit-msg runs Commitlint (Angular conventional commits).
- **Documentation**
  - **docs/CI_CD.md**: CI jobs (Quality Gates, E2E), pre-commit hooks, deploy workflow, local parity commands.
  - **docs/TESTING.md**: Testing strategy (backend Jest unit/integration, frontend Playwright E2E), where tests live, how to run them.
- **README.md**
  - CI and Deploy badges; new "CI/CD and testing" section linking to CI_CD.md and TESTING.md; "Code Quality Tools" and "Quality and test commands" updated (Husky steps, test and audit commands).

### Added - Last.fm per-user account linking

- **Per-user Last.fm linking**
  - Users can connect their own Last.fm account via `/lastfm link`; tracks they request are scrobbled to their profile. Optional env `LASTFM_SESSION_KEY` remains as fallback when the requester has not linked.
  - **Prisma**: New `LastFmLink` model and migration `20250129120000_add_lastfm_links` to store `discordId`, `sessionKey`, `lastFmUsername`.
  - **Shared**: `LastFmLinkService` (get/set session key by Discord id, unlink) in `packages/shared/src/services/LastFmLinkService`.
  - **Backend**: Routes `GET /api/lastfm/connect` (signed state, cookie, redirect to Last.fm) and `GET /api/lastfm/callback` (exchange token, store link, redirect to frontend). `LastFmAuthService` for token→session exchange. Cookie-parser middleware for state cookie.
  - **Bot**: `lastFmApi` refactored to accept per-user session key; `getSessionKeyForUser(discordId)` resolves DB link or env fallback. Track handlers pass requester’s session key to updateNowPlaying/scrobble.
  - **Discord**: `/lastfm link` and `/lastfm status` under general commands. Connect URL uses signed state (`LASTFM_LINK_SECRET` or `WEBAPP_SESSION_SECRET`) and base from `WEBAPP_REDIRECT_URI`.
  - **Docs**: `docs/LASTFM_SETUP.md` updated with per-user linking, callback URL for backend, and optional global session key. `.env.example`: `LASTFM_LINK_SECRET` comment added.

### Added - Project structure and conventions (ARCHITECTURE.md)

- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**
  - New section "Project structure and conventions": root layout, package layouts (shared, bot, backend, frontend), where to add new code, command loading rule for bot (top-level .ts or folder + re-export), principles for maintainability (consistency, shallow trees, one place for cross-cutting code, avoid big restructures, optional path aliases), and what not to do (no Prisma move, no extra abstraction layers, no throwaway scripts/docs).
- **README.md**
  - Link to ARCHITECTURE.md for package structure and conventions under Architecture section.

### Added - Cloudflare Tunnel, domain, and DNS for bot frontend

- **docs/CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_SETUP.md**
  - Guide for exposing the Lucky web app at a custom domain over HTTPS using Cloudflare Tunnel: add domain to Cloudflare, change nameservers, install `cloudflared`, create tunnel (remote or local), configure DNS (CNAME), set `WEBAPP_FRONTEND_URL` and `WEBAPP_REDIRECT_URI`, and optional quick tunnel for dev.
- **cloudflared/config.example.yml**
  - Example ingress config for a locally-managed tunnel pointing a hostname to the web app backend port.
- **.gitignore**
  - Ignore `cloudflared/*.json` and `cloudflared/config.yml` so tunnel credentials and local config are not committed.
- **.env.example**
  - Placeholder comments for production/custom domain: `WEBAPP_FRONTEND_URL`, `WEBAPP_REDIRECT_URI` when using Cloudflare Tunnel.

### Fixed - Discord slash command registration (all commands)

- **packages/bot**
  - Music commands were only registering 3 commands (autoplay, recommendation, play) because `music/commands/index.ts` returned a hardcoded list. Switched to `getCommandsFromDirectory` (same pattern as general and download) so all music command files in `functions/music/commands/` are loaded and registered with Discord.
  - Added `functions/music/commands/queue.ts` re-export so the queue command (in `queue/index.ts`) is loaded when scanning the directory.
  - All slash commands (general, download, music) are now sent to the Discord API on bot start; previously only a subset appeared in the client.

### Changed - DEPENDENCIES.md implementation

- **Root package.json**
  - Removed `cors` from dependencies and `@types/cors` from devDependencies so root stays minimal (`@prisma/client` only). `cors` is used only by backend and remains in `packages/backend`.
- **docs/DEPENDENCIES.md**
  - Updated Root section: dependencies are `@prisma/client` only; `cors` lives in backend.
  - Updated Backend section: types stay in devDependencies.
  - Updated Upgrade order: backend types and root cors cleanup reflected as done.

### Added - Twitch Criativaria and Last.fm API

- **Twitch**
  - Documented Criativaria notifications in `docs/TWITCH_SETUP.md` and README: run `/twitch add Criativaria` in the desired Discord channel to get alerts when Criativaria goes live.
- **Last.fm API**
  - Optional direct scrobbling and now-playing updates to a Last.fm account (in addition to the existing plain-text "Now playing" line for .fmbot).
  - `packages/bot/src/lastfm/`: `lastFmApi.ts` (signed POST, `track.updateNowPlaying`, `track.scrobble`) and `index.ts`.
  - Track handlers: on track start call Last.fm `updateNowPlaying` and store start time; on finish/skip call `scrobble` with stored timestamp. Disabled when `LASTFM_*` env vars are missing.
  - Env: `LASTFM_API_KEY`, `LASTFM_API_SECRET`, `LASTFM_SESSION_KEY` (see `docs/LASTFM_SETUP.md`).
  - **docs/LASTFM_SETUP.md**: API account, session key (web auth or mobile auth), behaviour, and references.

### Added - Dependency analysis and maintenance

- **docs/DEPENDENCIES.md**
  - New doc: NPM dependency overview, reliable/non-deprecated choices, package-by-package notes, upgrade order, and guidance to avoid bloat.
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**
  - Linked to DEPENDENCIES.md for dependency and upgrade details.
- **packages/backend**
  - Moved `@types/cors`, `@types/express`, `@types/express-session` to devDependencies (type-only; should not be production deps).
- **packages/bot**
  - Removed unused `module-alias` dependency; tsup resolves paths at build time.
  - Kept `unfetch` and `isomorphic-unfetch` in tsup `external` so the build can resolve a transitive dependency.
- **packages/shared**
  - Removed `src/types/module-alias.d.ts` (no longer needed after dropping module-alias in bot).

### Changed - Full cleanup refactor (packages-only architecture)

- **Architecture**
  - Production runs only `packages/bot` and `packages/backend`; root `src/` and root `tests/` have been removed.
  - Bot no longer depends on root `src/`: all bot code and services (music recommendation, autoplay, guild settings, track history) use `@lucky/shared` or live in `packages/bot`.
  - PM2 `ecosystem.config.cjs`: two apps, `lucky-bot` (packages/bot/dist/index.js) and `lucky-backend` (packages/backend/dist/index.js). Root `dist/index.js` no longer used.
  - Root `tsup.config.ts` removed; build is workspace-only (`npm run build` builds shared, bot, backend).
- **packages/shared**
  - `TrackHistoryService`, `GuildSettingsService`, and related types exported from `@lucky/shared/services`.
  - Removed duplicate `TrackHistoryEntry` from `types/music.ts` (only exported from `TrackHistoryService`).
- **packages/bot**
  - `MusicRecommendationService` and `musicRecommendation/` (recommendationEngine, similarityCalculator, types, vectorOperations) moved from root into `packages/bot/src/services/`; uses `trackHistoryService` and `@lucky/shared/utils` for logging.
  - Autoplay and counters use `guildSettingsService` and `trackHistoryService` from `@lucky/shared/services` instead of root `ServiceFactory`.
  - `stringUtils` and title comparison already in bot; no root dependency.
- **Testing**
  - Root `test` script runs backend tests only: `npm run test --workspace=packages/backend`.
  - Added `test:ci`, `test:coverage`, `check:outdated` for CI.
  - Root `jest.config.cjs` updated to run `packages/backend` tests when Jest is run from repo root.
- **Docs**
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: clarified that production is packages-only and shared is the single source for DB, Redis, feature toggles, track history, guild settings; where to add new commands (bot) and API routes (backend).
- **packages/frontend**
  - Removed unused `featureStore.ts`; only `featuresStore.ts` is used (useFeaturesStore in hooks and components).
- **packages/bot**
  - Lyrics command: reply text updated to "Lyrics are not available yet" so it is clearly documented as not implemented rather than a bug.
  - Twitch add/remove: await `twitchNotificationService.add` and `remove` so success checks use the resolved boolean.
  - Title comparison: fixed `stringUtils` import path to `../../misc/stringUtils` (from `utils/music/titleComparison`).

### Fixed - Shared package and code quality

- **packages/shared**
  - Removed broken `ServiceFactory` export (file did not exist in shared; bot uses `@lucky/shared` services directly).
  - Added `src/types/optional-infisical.d.ts` so the build passes when optional dependency `@infisical/sdk` is not installed.

### Added - Twitch stream-online notifications

- **docs/TWITCH_SETUP.md**
  - Added step-by-step **Register your application** section: Twitch Developer Console, form fields (Name, OAuth Redirect URLs with HTTPS requirement, Category, Client type Confidential), and where to get Client ID and Client Secret.
- **Twitch EventSub WebSocket integration**
  - Notify a Discord channel when a configured Twitch streamer goes live
  - EventSub over WebSocket (no public HTTP endpoint); uses user access token for subscriptions
  - Slash commands: `/twitch add <username>`, `/twitch remove <username>`, `/twitch list`
  - Env: `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`, `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TWITCH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `TWITCH_REFRESH_TOKEN` (see `docs/TWITCH_SETUP.md`)
- **Prisma**
  - New `TwitchNotification` model (guild, twitch user, Discord channel); migration added

### Added - .fmbot / Last.fm scrobbling

- **Now Playing visibility for .fmbot**
  - Lucky always sends a plain-text "Now playing: Artist – Title" message when a track starts (autoplay or manual), so .fmbot and other scrobblers can see and scrobble playback when they share the channel

### Added - Cursor rules, skills, and agents

- **Cursor rules**
  - `lucky-project.mdc`: project structure, stack, package layout, conventions (always apply)
  - `lucky-discord-bot.mdc`: Discord commands, player, handlers (packages/bot)
  - `lucky-backend-api.mdc`: Express API, auth, routes (packages/backend)
  - `lucky-frontend.mdc`: React app, pages, components (packages/frontend)
  - `lucky-shared.mdc`: shared config, DB, Redis, types, utils (packages/shared)
- **Skills**
  - `discord-commands`: add or change slash commands
  - `music-queue-player`: play/queue/skip, player lifecycle, track handling
  - `prisma-redis-lucky`: Prisma schema/migrations, Redis usage in shared
  - `lucky-docker-dev`: Docker, compose, local dev runs
- **AGENTS.md**
  - Project summary, rule/skill mapping, when to use which MCP (filesystem, GitHub, Context7, Tavily, Playwright, etc.), agent behavior and commands reference

### Added - MCP setup

- **MCP configuration and docs**
  - `docs/MCP_SETUP.md`: how to configure MCP servers and secrets for Cursor
  - Wrapper scripts and `.env.mcp.example` live under `~/.cursor/` (global Cursor config); secrets are loaded from `~/.cursor/.env.mcp` instead of being hardcoded in `mcp.json`
  - Filesystem MCP server path set to Lucky workspace; chrome-devtools and remote servers use `-y` for non-interactive npx
- **MCP failing-tools fixes**
  - GitHub: use npx `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` via `run-mcp-github.sh` (no Docker)
  - cloudflare-observability / cloudflare-bindings: use distinct OAuth callback ports (3335, 3336) to avoid EADDRINUSE
  - infisical-craftvaria re-added to `mcp.json`; troubleshooting section in `docs/MCP_SETUP.md` for fetch (Docker), Infisical (env vars)
  - BrowserStack: dedicated `run-mcp-browserstack.sh`; skip cleanly when `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME`/`BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` unset (no init error)
  - Infisical wrappers: skip cleanly when project env vars unset
  - fetch: removed from default `mcp.json` (requires Docker); doc explains how to re-add

### Added - Infisical

- **Optional Infisical integration for environment variables**
  - `ensureEnvironment()` in shared config: loads `.env` first, then fetches Infisical secrets when `INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID`, `INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID`, and `INFISICAL_ENV` are set
  - Bot and backend entrypoints use `ensureEnvironment()` so Infisical works without code changes
  - Optional dependency `@infisical/sdk`; app runs without it when Infisical is not configured
  - `.env.example` documents Infisical-related variables
  - `docs/INFISICAL.md` with setup, MCP usage, and Docker notes
